Oct 2022

This project aims to implement and compare different algorithms for Monte Carlo
learning. Given a race track, start and finish line, the agent (race car) is
tasked with finding out the route to maximize reward.

Policies tried so far in this project:
1. Random Monte Carlo
2. Epsilon Greedy Monte Carlo
